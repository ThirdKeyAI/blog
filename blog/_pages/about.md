# About ThirdKey Research

ThirdKey Research is dedicated to advancing AI security through our "Zero Trust for AI" approach. We believe that **every AI interaction should be verified, every model should be validated, and every decision should be auditable**.

## Our Mission

As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into critical systems and decision-making processes, the need for robust security frameworks has never been more urgent. Traditional security models that rely on perimeter defense are insufficient for the dynamic, distributed nature of AI systems.

We focus on extending Zero Trust principles to artificial intelligence systems, applying the philosophy of "never trust, always verify" to AI interactions, model behavior, and system integrity.

## Research Projects

### SchemaPin
**Cryptographic Security for AI Tool Schemas**

A cryptographic protocol for ensuring the integrity and authenticity of tool schemas used by AI agents. SchemaPin prevents "MCP Rug Pull" attacks by enabling developers to cryptographically sign their tool schemas and allowing clients to verify that schemas have not been altered since publication.

- **Website**: [schemapin.org](https://schemapin.org)
- **Features**: ECDSA P-256 signatures, Trust-On-First-Use key pinning, cross-language support
- **License**: MIT
